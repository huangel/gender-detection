Audio Gender Identification Using Machine Learning and Python 

Background noise removal is applied. 

Libraries to install:
	pip install pickle
	pip install python_speech_features
	pip install pysndfx
	pip install librosa

ML - Training: 
- training.py
- Gaussian mixture models for classification
- Trained on 559 female clips and 547 male clips (in train_data folder)
- the two .gmm files in the folder are the latest trained versions of the clips 
  (it took 950s to train each .gmm file)

ML - Test and Validation:
- test.py
- feeds in the already trained GMM file

This can be applied to other audio identification applications, like voice recognition and other classifications. Each “group” needs a .gmm file. 

Note: 
This fusion equation doesn’t work for males who talk in high pitch (like the recording ./test_data/male/male5.wav)
